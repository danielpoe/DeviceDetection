Simple Javascript Device Detection based on user agend.

Usage:
-------

var detection = DeviceDetection();
detection.isApple();
detection.isTouchDevice();
detection.isAndroid();
detection.isSmartPhone();
detection.isDesktop();
detection.isTablet();

Development / Status:
---------------------

The lib is just the current working status. Its not yet tested on all diffrent user agents.
But it should be easy to add more tests.

For development please check the QUnit based Unittests and add your user agend strings there.
